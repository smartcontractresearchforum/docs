# How to Get Compensated for Work

## Where do I Find Work?

Look for announcements on the [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/), check [Github](https://github.com/orgs/smartcontractresearchforum/projects/5) for active projects that interest you, or ask directly, by going into the [Chat](https://discord.gg/nJDwxv72) and asking how to get involved.

## What Kind of Work is Available at SCRF?

There’s a wide variety of work at SCRF, from writing Research Summaries to copy editing and graphic design to various administrative roles. We support flexible disbursement schedules, honoraria, grants, and other arrangements.

As researchers become more deeply engaged with projects, or take on larger pieces of work, we have longer-term relationships available, including salaried positions.

_We pay in cryptocurrency. For longer commitments, alternative arrangements can be made._

If you cannot accept funds due to organizational or legal reasons, we can discuss alternative options. This could include:

* funding a project
* conference travel
* charitable donations to an endowment in lieu
* credits for compute resources, archive nodes, etc
* supporting a blockchain-related organization or event of your choice

Pay varies according to the complexity of the assignment and the time involved. Contributors who commit to longer-term engagements and have produced a good body of work for the forum are encouraged to seek additional and more lucrative responsibilities.

## Tracking Hours

SCRF pays contributors by the hour. Hours are tracked in [a spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19CmaqELKS_S2gWQIs2kddA91rv5zca-51mk_sOJ0gYs/edit?usp=sharing) that is submitted once a month with your invoice (see below). Please share a copy of this sheet with your team lead.

## Invoicing and Payment System

SCRF pays invoices once per month at the end of the month. **_All invoices are due five business days before the end of the month._** If you forget to include an item, add it to your next invoice with a description. SCRF uses Request Network for payments. SCRF may process another round of payments mid-month (on the 15th) as needed as well. 

To use the Request Network system, you will need an email address and an Ethereum wallet.

1. Use an Ethereum address. 
2. Use an Ethereum address (SCRF recommends [MetaMask](https://metamask.io/) but you can use an exchange wallet if you plan on just transferring your funds to fiat right away)
3. Follow the instructions given for creating an account on [Request Network](https://app.request.finance/login).
4. All invoices must be submitted at least 2 full working days before the end of the calendar month in order to qualify for the monthly net 30 billing cycle.
5. Create an invoice.
    1. For your invoice currency, choose DAI.
    2. **We pay in the DAI stablecoin**. Please select it as the payment cryptocurrency.
    3. Add a new client, using the email address "invoice(at)scrf.io" as a client.
    4. Ensure that you provide your full name and your **_chat username in the memo field_**
6. Include a detailed description of the work you’ve done for each line item.
    * Example: "small research summary of Bitcoin Whitepaper," USD 200...
7. Submit the invoice.
8. Please get in touch with the Ops team on our [Chat](https://discord.gg/nJDwxv72) if you do not receive payment or have questions, concerns, or need an alternate arrangement.
