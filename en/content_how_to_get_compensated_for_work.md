# How to Get Compensated for Work

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](smartcontractresearch.org) (SCRF) has created “How to Get Compensated for Work” for individuals to learn about SCRF’s payment system.

## Overview

This document covers how to track hours, create an invoice, alternative payment methods, and important notes. Recently onboarded contributors and recipients of grants, awards, or rewards need to follow the steps below to receive compensation.

## Tracking Hours

Anyone working for SCRF is expected to track their hours using the template sheet and process outlined below. Anyone submitting bounties or non-hours-based grants can ignore this step.

* Make a copy of the [Hours Template Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/19CmaqELKS_S2gWQIs2kddA91rv5zca-51mk_sOJ0gYs/edit#gid=0) and title it ‘[Your Name] Hours’.
* Track time worked in 30-minute increments on the spreadsheet copy.
* Provide a detailed description of work completed for each line item.
* Submit the template at the end of the month with an invoice.

## Invoicing and Payment System

SCRF officially pays invoices once per month at the end of the month. SCRF may process another round of payments mid-month, in certain situations. **All invoices are due two full business days before the end of the month**. Any billable hours forgotten or worked after the invoice was submitted can be added to the next invoice with a description. SCRF uses Request Network for all payments.

* Use an Ethereum address. (SCRF recommends [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) but any exchange wallet is acceptable when transferring funds to a fiat wallet right away.)
* Create an account on [Request Network](https://app.request.finance/login).
* Choose USD for invoice currency.
* Select DAI stablecoin as the payment cryptocurrency.
* Add a new client using the email address invoice@scrf.io.

  * _Note: Other fields can be left blank._
* Provide full name and chat username in the memo field.
* Attach a copy of your version of [Your Name] Hours Template Sheet or provide a link to the sheet.
  * For those submitting bounties, it is not required to include hours but please include a link to your submission.
* Submit the invoice for payment.

## Compensation & Logistics

If unable to accept funds directly, alternative compensation options could include:

* Funding a project
* Conference travel
* Charitable donations to an [endowment](https://thegivingblock.com/donate/)
* Credits for compute resources, archive nodes, etc.
* Direct support of a blockchain-related organization or event of choice.

* Please note that participation in community calls, events, and cohorts are not billable.
* Invoices are due two full business days before the end of each month. Make sure to keep an eye on the Discord chat for any announcements, such as holidays, that may impact the invoice due date.
* The pay rate varies according to the complexity and time requirements of assignments.
