# SCRF Contributor Recognition and Rewards Initiative

The Smart Contract Research Forum (SCRF) has created the Recognition and Rewards Initiative to feature and encourage thoughtful engagement and high-quality contributions to the forum and chat.

 

Throughout each month, outstanding comments are identified on the forum and chat.  At the end of the month, a curated list of exemplary contributions is presented to SCRF’s moderation team, who selects three finalists to be considered for comment of the month. SCRF’s community then elects one winner through a chat poll on the [#general](https://discord.com/channels/784234332617048065/784234333111451670) channel.  Winners are featured on SCRF’s social platforms, chat, and forum.

SCRF aims to advance this initiative to include a post of the month and comment of the week in the near future.

## Eligibility

Everyone is eligible for recognition aside from ops members. Contributors on payroll do not qualify for monetary rewards but may still receive recognition for their work.

## How to Get Paid

A winning comment of the month will receive up to $150.  To learn how to invoice for payment reference [“How to Get Compensated for Work”](https://github.com/smartcontractresearchforum/docs/blob/main/en/content_how_to_get_compensated_for_work.md).  Please note that invoices are received and paid several days prior to the end of each month.  

## Content Guidelines

Use the following guidelines when crafting responses on the forum or in the chat. This direction entails generalized criteria rather than an exhaustive list of requirements. Locate additional writing tips in the [“Style Guide”](https://github.com/smartcontractresearchforum/docs/blob/main/en/reference_style_guide.md).

Comments on the forum can be responses to posts such as Research Summaries, Discussion Posts, Post Ideas, Mini-Posts, and Reading Group discussions. Generally, comments on forum posts are encouraged to:



* Ask thoughtful questions
* Introduce sources outside of the original post
* Invite or tag other community members to engage and share their ideas
* Contribute to areas that may not have been addressed or considered

Relevant comments on SCRF’s #general chat channel may: 



* Share current events, trends, or topics of interest
* Spark engagement and garner feedback
* Offer helpful material to other members of the community

## Important to Note

Winning comments are at the discretion of SCRF and its community.
