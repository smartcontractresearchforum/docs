# SCRF Contributor Recognition and Rewards Initiative

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) (SCRF) has created the Contributor Recognition and Rewards Initiative to feature and encourage thoughtful engagement and high-quality contributions to the forum and chat.

## Overview

Throughout each month, SCRF identifies outstanding comments on the forum and chat. At the end of the month, SCRF's moderation team selects finalists for comment of the month. SCRF’s community then determines the winners by voting through a [poll on the forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/scrf-contributor-recognition-and-rewards-initiative/860). SCRF features winning comments on its social platforms, chat, and forum.

## Eligibility

The SCRF community is eligible for participation as part of this program. SCRF community members who receive grants or compensation for forum content do not qualify for monetary rewards but will still receive recognition for their work. In lieu of this, SCRF will donate to their charity of choice.

## How to Qualify

The following lays out general guidelines for creating content and posting to the SCRF forum and chat. Writing specifications can be found in the ["SCRF Writing Style Guide."](https://github.com/smartcontractresearchforum/docs/blob/main/en/reference_style_guide.md)

Comments on the forum can be responses to posts such as Research Summaries, Discussion Posts, Post Ideas, Mini-Posts, and Reading Group discussions. Generally, comments on forum posts and in the [#general](https://discord.com/channels/784234332617048065/784234333111451670) chat are encouraged to:

* Ask thoughtful questions
* Introduce quality sources outside of the original post
* Invite or tag other community members to engage and share their ideas
* Contribute to areas that may not have been addressed or considered
* Share current events, trends, or topics of interest
* Spark engagement and garner feedback
* Offer helpful material to other members of the community
