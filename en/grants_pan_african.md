# SCRF Pan-African Microgrant Program

The [Smart Contract Research Forum](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/) (SCRF) has created the Pan-African Microgrant Program to provide microgrants to the students and alumni of African universities.


## Overview

The Pan-African Microgrant Program is the first of SCRF’s regional grants efforts, focusing initially on Western Africa. The program’s goal is to extend microgrants to academics and researchers to write [Research Summaries](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/tag/summary) based on African academic papers, regional blockchain [case studies](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/public-procurement-corruption-and-blockchain-technology-in-south-africa-a-preliminary-legal-inquiry/744), or regional [use case examinations](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/research-summary-using-distributed-ledger-technologies-to-improve-and-maximise-the-collection-of-property-taxes/1176).

From the early adoption of solar power to mobile phone usage and mobile payments, Africa has a long history of technological “leapfrogging.” The continent has proven time and again that it is capable of radical technical innovation and developing nations in the region are perfectly positioned to leapfrog the legacy financial system through the widespread adoption of blockchain. Yet, these developments remain largely unknown outside of Africa.

Through this program, SCRF aims to publish a steady stream of public and open African-focused research that may not be available to the broader crypto community.


## Eligibility

Graduate and undergraduate students are eligible for participation in this program. Academics, researchers, and industry participants are also welcome to [apply](https://forms.gle/GLvFbGZekjaAggXr8). Applicants should be affiliated with an African university, an African research institution, or come from an African country while currently studying abroad.


## How to Qualify

Applicants should have interest and insights into blockchain technologies and be comfortable writing Research Summaries, Case Study Summaries, or Use Case examinations.

To be considered for this grant, first, submit an [application](https://forms.gle/GLvFbGZekjaAggXr8). Upon approval, complete a Research Summary, Case Study Summary, or Use Case examination within four to eight weeks. The program completion time depends upon the length of the article or paper and the review process that occurs to ensure the summaries achieve the highest quality. During this time, researchers are expected to attend regular check-in meetings, which can be coordinated using this [calendar link](https://calendly.com/chrisbates01/30min).

SCRF may offer long-term opportunities to successful grantees and ask them to submit additional grant applications.


## Compensation & Logistics 

Grant recipients will receive $300 to write a single Research Summary, Case Study Summary, or Use Case examination.

SCRF pays in cryptocurrency. For longer commitments, alternative arrangements can be made. Follow the steps outlined in "[How to Get Compensated for Work](https://github.com/smartcontractresearchforum/docs/blob/main/en/content_how_to_get_compensated_for_work.md)" to claim the grant after SCRF announces the recipients.

If unable to accept funds directly, alternative options could include:



* Funding a project
* Conference travel
* Charitable donations to an endowment
* Credits for cloud computing resources, archive nodes, etc.
* Direct support of a blockchain-related organization or event of choice
