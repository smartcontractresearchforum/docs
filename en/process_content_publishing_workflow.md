# SCRF: Process - Content Publishing Workflow

This document details the publication process for documents that will appear in the forum, and contains up-to-date information on who does what, where to find docs, and when things should happen. A link to the GitHub can be found here: [Document Pipeline](https://github.com/orgs/smartcontractresearchforum/projects/5).

## Idea Proposal
This is a step for capturing ideas for posts or notes for a potential post.
1. [Content] Researchers should create a card in Ideas List in GitHub
    - Title: “Research Summary: Title of Paper”
    - 1 sentence description about why this summary is relevant, novel and timely
    - Link to source
    - Link to draft if applicable
    - 1-3 proposed subtags
    - Sizing: Small, Medium, Large
    - Assignee: Author
    - In-draft: Any part of Go-to-market (GTM) strategy if applicable
1. [Content] Researchers should create a post in the Post Ideas [category](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/c/post-ideas/23) of the forum and write a short post about why the summary or discussion post being proposed would be relevant, novel, and timely and what they think is interesting about it. 
1. [Content] SCRF team lead should have a discussion about the go-to-market plan for a given post and its value to the forum and carry out this discussion in the appropriate forum category.
1. [Content] The SCRF team lead will respond to post-ideas and approve associated cards (including proposed tags, sizing, and prioritization), or reject with feedback (move cards to icebox or be archived). 
1. [Engagement] Once ideas have been approved, the Moderation Owner updates the Go to Market Tracking document with:
    - Priority status of the post
    - Type of post / go to market plan
        - New posts with active GTM strategy and an engagement event is being built around the post
        - New posts with active GTM strategies to execute
    - Author of the post
    - Moderator assigned to the post
    - Link to the github ticket for the post
    - Link to the go to market plan for the post

## Drafting
This is a step for posts that are actively being written or rewritten. Note: If researchers reference external materials with direct quotation or paraphrasing, all sources must be cited.
1. [Content] Once you have some confidence that you are planning to start on a draft and the Research Lead has approved the idea, create a card in the ideas list in Github. That card should contain the following:
    - Link to a Google document for the draft that follows a content type template
    - A tag in github for the content type
    - A couple of topic area tags
    - Justification / criteria qualifications for the post idea (or link to appropriate post idea in the forum)
1. [Content] Move the issue into the Peer Review phase when ready for review
1. [Content] Add any issues or blockers to the card description as surfaced or flag ready for review as a comment in the card as well.
1. [Content] Ping the Research Lead role in discord for questions or blockers
1. [Content] On Fridays, the Research Lead will make themselves available to the team for “Office Hours” to address roadblocks and discuss reviews with researchers as needed.

## Peer Review
This is a phase for initial checks by peers on complete or in-progress drafts. 
1. [Content] Once initial drafting is complete, authors should move their drafts into the Peer Review phase in GitHub. 
1. [Content] The author should tag a particular team member for peer review (and assign them to the GitHub card), otherwise a reviewer will be assigned (based on content team expertise documentation)
1. [Content] Peer reviewers should exchange comments about a draft with the author in the draft google document and/or in discord. [Content] Peer reviewers should review for:
    - Grammar and spelling
    - General readability
    - Correctness
    - Simplicity and organization of information 
    - Viable go to market strategy (questions, narratives, related conversations)
1. [Content] Once the peer reviewer signs off, the author should move the card into the Final Content Review list

## Final Content Review 
This is a phase for final checks by content reviewers to ideally just confirm that content looks good for publishing. 
1. [Content] The research team lead or other verified content reviewers will perform a final check on content before editorial review
    - Content reviewer performs a lightweight check for 1) correctness, 2) relevancy/topicality, 3) accessibility, and 4) adherence to templates/standards
    - Content reviewers can move posts back to drafting as needed, updating card with comments describing any issues. This will likely entail multiple back-and-forth exchanges between the researcher and the reviewer.
    - Content reviewers flag changes to authors via comments in-document and on the GitHub card
    - Only content reviewers can move the GitHub card to the Editorial Review list
1. [Engagement] Once drafts move into final content review, the Moderation Owner updates the go-to-market Tracking Doc with a link to the draft and adds the Go to market Questionnaire at the top of Draft document
1. [Engagement] Moderation Owner updates ticket with request to researcher to review GTM Questionnaire
    - Moderation Owner Creates GTM Doc using GTM [Template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kqPc_X_iDs_TtmaAahAYiu9-PCVS_GLC964FbAav5-c/edit)
    - Draft initial social media posts using  [SCRF: Social Media Presence Plan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10o9q1bPOEjULd-XMtbMUVOzjTe50RNamqeDPb_t9Nas/edit#) template

## Editorial Review
This is a step for Editorial Lead and other verified editorial reviewers to perform final checks for writing style, grammar, spelling, or other editorial mistakes before publication
1. [Content] The Editor reads posts and provides comments and suggested edits for the author. Editorial reviewers should:
    - Review for:
        - Tone and style
        - Grammar and spelling
        - Formatting
        - General readability and simplicity of information delivery.
    - Check for:
        - Use available tools to check for plagiarism
        - Any important definitions that should be added to the terms [glossary](https://www.smartcontractresearch.org/t/scrf-terms-glossary-and-content-tags/364) 
1. [Content] Once edited, only verified editors can move posts into the Engagement phase. 
    - Editors can move drafts back into the Drafting phase for corrections

## Engagement and Calendaring
This is a phase for developing go-to-market strategies and calendaring release dates for post and/or social media activity.
1. [Engagement] The Engagement Team will read and review content in the Engagement and Calendaring list in GitHub
1. [Engagement] They will then schedule a time to interface with the author of the post.
1. [Engagement] Engagement Team will present a go-to-market strategy draft to the post author. Additionally, outstanding questions, social media strategies, and moderation strategies will be discussed so that the go-to-market strategy can be finalized within 24 hours.
        - Notes are stored in the GTM Doc
        - Moderation owner has answers to Researcher GTM questions
        - Moderation owner has answers to Social Media GTM questions
1. [Engagement] Once the interview is complete, the Engagement Team will take over calendaring of post publication. 
1. [Engagement] The Engagement team will then ask the author to post content to the forum at the appropriate time
1. [Engagement] Moderation Owner creates Go To Market plan based on this interview within 24 hours. The engagement team will then implement the go-to-market plan for that particular post.
1. [Engagement] Social drafts are moved to Social Media Queue Doc
1. Assign appropriate Social Media handler via comment and DM that socials are ready for review
1. [Engagement] Put Socials on calendaring schedule
1. [Engagement] Update ticket with “Engagement sign off” 

## Published
This phase describes the steps after a post has been published to the forum.
1. [Engagement] Once Published, the Moderation owner moves ticket to published
    - GTM Tracker status: Published
1. [Engagement] Moderation owner implements and documents Got To Market plan that is stored in GTM Doc
    - GTM Tracker status is updated with each action taken
1. [Engagement] Moderation owner uses philosophy of [Moderation Playbook](https://docs.google.com/document/d/190rBZGylcaHBojMSMm-ZfIxPdLxzKv2I1G1zLjIhzfk/edit#heading=h.ujjvwbujjbt6) to moderate/encourage discourse
1. [Engagement] Moderation owner uses Chat to publicly connect research team to discussions on SCRF
1. [Engagement] When GTM priority is set to change, the Moderation owner will give a short presentation to the Engagement team.
    - Go through each element of GTM and demonstrate success or failure
    - Indicate all steps taken as best as possible
